HTML:

The form contains three input fields for name, email, and password.
A button to submit the form.
A div with id result to display the submitted data.
CSS:

The <style> tag within the <head> section contains all the CSS code for styling the page.
The .container class styles the form container, while .result styles the div that will display the registration details.
JavaScript:

The <script> tag at the end of the <body> section contains all the JavaScript code needed to handle form submission and display the entered data.
When the form is submitted, the event listener prevents the default form submission behavior, retrieves the values from the input fields, and displays them in the result div.
This single HTML file includes all the necessary code to create a registration form that displays the submitted data on the same page, with inline styles and scripts.
